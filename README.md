## Mindset
1. You should conceive the purpose of the software to right a goog one
2. Your design should be easy for you and helpful for others. 
3. be sure that you fully understand the systems and tools you are working with
4. good developer creates things that are easy to understand 
5. your first behavior should be resistance to (unnecessary) change
6. thinking about future maintenance of changes is one of your main responsibilities.
7. Code that isn’t consistent becomes harder to understand
8. The changes that will bring you a lot of value and require little effort are better than those that will bring little value and require a lot of effort.
9. Think before acting (understanding planning) 
Divide it into smaller tasks and solve each sub-problem one by one
10. Start small, improve it, then extend
11. Being too generic involves a lot of code that isn’t needed
12. Don’t predict to future. Be only as generic as you know you need to be right now.
13. Code should be designed based on what you know now, not on what you think will happen
14. Don’t reinvent the wheel
15. Always resist adding more code if it's unnecessary
16. If you can automate it, automate it
17. The optimum code is a small bunch of code that is easy to understand, easy to read.
18. keeping your code base as small as possible.
19. Untested code is the code that doesn’t work.
20. Refactoring should be the first option not rewrite
21. Write a comment to explain “WHY”, not to explain “WHAT”.
22. Don’t depend on external technologies
23. Keep learning, Know that every specific problem has its own specific solution.
24. Don’t be obsessive. Know when to quit. 
25. always seek advice
